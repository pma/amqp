  Provides an easy way to access an AMQP connection.

  The connection will be monitored by AMQP's GenServer and it will
  automatically try to reconnect when the connection is gone.

  ## Usage

  When you want to have a single connection in your app:

      config :amqp, connection: [
          url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:15672"
        ]

  You can also use any options available on `AMQP.Connection.open/2`:

      config :amqp, connection: [
          host: "localhost",
          port: 15672
          username: "guest",
          password: "guest"
        ]

  Then the connection will be open at the start of the application and you can
  access via this function.

      iex> {:ok, conn} = AMQP.Application.get_connection()

  By default, it tries to connect to your local RabbitMQ. You can simply pass
  the empty keyword list too:

      config :amqp, connection: [] # == [url: "amqp://0.0.0.0"]

  You can set up multiple connections wth `:connections` key:

      config :amqp, connections: [
          business_report: [
            url: "amqp://host1"
          ],
          analytics: [
            url: "amqp://host2"
          ]
        ]

  Then you can access each connection with its name.

      iex> {:ok, conn1} = AMQP.Application.get_connection(:business_report)
      iex> {:ok, conn2} = AMQP.Application.get_connection(:analytics)

  The default name is :default so These two configurations are equivalent:

      config :amqp, connection: []
      config :amqp, connections: [default: []]

  ## Configuration options

    * `:retry_interval` - The retry interval in milliseconds when the connection
      is failed to open. (default `5000`)

    * `:url` - AMQP URI for the connection

  See also `AMQP.Connection.open/2` for all available options.

  Provides an easy way to access an AMQP channel.

  AMQP.Application provides a wrapper on top of `AMQP.Channel` with .

  The channel will be monitored by AMQP's GenServer and it will automatically
  try to reopen when the channel is gone.

  ## Usage

  When you want to have a single channel in your app:

      config :amqp,
        connection: [url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:15672"],
        channel: []

  Then the channel will be open at the start of the application and you can
  access it via this function.

      iex> {:ok, chan} = AMQP.Application.get_channel()

  You can also set up multiple channels with `:channels` key:

      config :amqp,
        connections: [
          business_report: [url: "amqp://host1"],
          analytics: [url: "amqp://host2"]
        ],
        channels: [
          bisiness_report: [connection: :business_report],
          analytics: [connection: :analytics]
        ]

  Then you can access each channel with its name.

      iex> {:ok, conn1} = AMQP.Application.get_channel(:business_report)
      iex> {:ok, conn2} = AMQP.Application.get_channel(:analytics)

  You can also have multiple channels for a single connection.

      config :amqp,
        connection: [],
        channels: [
          consumer: [],
          producer: []
        ]

  ## Configuration options

    * `:connection` - The connection name configured with `connection` or
      `connections` (default `:default`)

    * `:retry_interval` - The retry interval in milliseconds when the channel is
      failed to open (default `5000`)

  ## Caveat

  Although AMQP will reopen the named channel automatically when it is closed
  for some reasons, your application still needs to monitor the channel for a
  consumer process.

  Be aware the channel reopened doesn't automatically recover the subscription
  of your consumer

  Here is a sample GenServer module that monitors the channel and re-subscribe
  the channel.

      defmodule AppConsumer do
        use GenServer
        @channel :default
        @queue "myqueue"

        ....

        def handle_info(:subscribe, state) do
          case subscribe() do
            {:ok, chan} ->
              {:noreply, Map.put(state, :channel, chan)}
            _ ->
              {:noreply, state}
          end
        end

        def handle_info({:DOWN, _, :process, pid, reason}, %{channel: %{pid: pid}} = state) do
          send(self(), :subscribe)
          {:noreply, Map.put(state, :channel, nil)}
        end

        defp subscribe() do
          case AMQP.Application.get_channel(@channel) do
            {:ok, chan} ->
              Process.monitor(chan.pid)
              {:ok, _consumer_tag} = AMQP.Basic.consume(@channel, @queue)
              {:ok, chan}

            _error ->
              Process.send_after(self(), :subscribe, 1000)
              {:error, :retrying}
          end
        end
      end
