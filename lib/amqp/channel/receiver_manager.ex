  # Manages receivers.
  #
  # AMQP relays messages from a channel to a client and convert
  # [Record](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Record.html) to the data structure which
  # is familiar with Elixir developer (Tuple, Map).
  # We call the processes in between a channel and a client Receiver and
  # this module manages them.
  #
  # This module ensures to have a single Receiver per a channel and a client.
  # With that way, the sequence of the messages from channel would be always
  # preserved.
